  "The governor contract as executable tests -- this vertical's own
  scope boundary ('does NOT control assembly-line equipment
  directly... does NOT authorize or execute maintenance/equipment
  operations... does NOT self-issue a transport-equipment safety/
  roadworthiness certification') implemented faithfully. The single
  invariant under test:

    OtherTransportAdvisor never schedules maintenance, flags a safety
    concern, or coordinates a shipment the Other Transport Equipment
    Plant Operations Governor would reject; `:schedule-maintenance`/
    `:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` NEVER auto-commit at
    any phase; `:log-production-batch` (no physical/financial risk)
    MAY auto-commit when clean; and every decision (commit OR hold)
    leaves exactly one ledger fact."
